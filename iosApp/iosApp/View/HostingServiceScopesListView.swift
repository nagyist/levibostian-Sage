/**
 This screen is meant to list all of the scopes that are available with the ability to enable and disable them. you choose what permissions the app gets. Well, not exactly list the scopes but list all of the fetures that each permission uses.
 Read files will enable feature to view all files in app.
 Write files will enable organizing into albums.
 Share files will enable sharing photos with people.
 
 We know it's scope, but we instead present it as features.
 
 What is the purpose?
 1. we want to give you the feeling that you are in control.
 2. we want to not annoy you. I was at first going to have you login X number of times where each time you wanted to use a feature we would login again for adding that scope. But I figured that could be annoying to login X number of times when some people would rather just enable all of the fetures they want to use and not have to login.
 
 
 This is a feature that doesn't need to exist when the app launches. We can build it later. So, for now, it's being skipped.
